A library for all the data structures in C#. Every class will be generic and reusable. It uses [http://research.microsoft.com/contracts](http://research.microsoft.com/contracts "Code Contract") library.

**Caution:** This library is under development and not tested. Anything can break.

Implemented data structures are:

- AVL Tree
- B+ Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Search Tree (Transpose)
- Binomial Heap
- Bloom Filter
- Compressed Trie
- Concurrent Hash Set
- Directed Acyclic Word Graph
- Heap
- Heap Structured Binary Tree
- Interval Tree
- List (Move to front heuristics)
- List (Frequency count heuristics)
- List (Transpose heuristics)
- Red Black Tree
- Region Quad Tree
- Rooted Tree
- Splay Tree
- Skip List
- Trie
